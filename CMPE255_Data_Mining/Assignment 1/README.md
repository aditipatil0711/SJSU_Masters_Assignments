Showcase the power of combining chatgpt plugin and visual studio code 
Best submission will be judged by students in a poll organized by TA.

Answer:
  1) Writing functions and Codes:

     Description:
     In this video, I have tried to explain how we can use Github Copilot to write code and functions so tasks for developers can be easy so can avoid rewriting boilerplate codes. All a user has to do is write their requirements in the code and Voila! Your code for the functionality is created! This demo is implemented to create a basic calculator code.
     
     
  2) Refactoring a code:

     Description:
     In this video, I have tried to explain how we can use Github Copilot to refactor existing codes. Github Copilot Chat makes it easier to refactor code. But being in waitlist, I have tried refactoring with just the Copilot plugin. This demo is implemented on a Calculator application written in React.
     
  3) Writing unit test:

     Description:
      In this video, I have added a test case to the same code basic calculator app in video 1. with Github copilot, you explain the requirements in the test case and copilot helps you generate test cases easily. 

     
  4) Writing entire app:

     https://youtu.be/vMuBHpVyL70?si=ayDJw2XuzXLt7J8h
     
     Description:
     In this video, I have used gpt-engineer to generate an app with its directory structure. The user can write in the main_prompt file about the functionality of the code to be suitable to run. The developer now is set to work on the application according to the end goals of the project using that application.


     Note:
     Github Copilot, ChatGPT and gpt-engineer (for the Generative AI platforms used in this assignments) are helpful to generate code in initial forms. It does not mean that the application/ code generated is ready to use. A developer will always have to change variable names, or parameters or details to make the app seamlessly working.
