# EDA, Data Preparation, and AutoML on Kaggle Datasets

This repository contains detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preparation, and processing workflows for a variety of Kaggle datasets. Each dataset represents a different type of data, ranging from tabular to video, and demonstrates comprehensive data cleaning, feature processing, and machine learning modeling using AutoML techniques.

## Solution Overview

The goal of this project was to conduct EDA, data preparation, and processing on popular Kaggle datasets that required cleaning. The datasets chosen represent a wide array of data types including tabular, time series, spatio-temporal, image, audio, video, and graph data. The project ensured a mix of imbalanced and balanced datasets and involved detailed preprocessing, clustering, anomaly detection, data imputation, feature processing, and feature selection. AutoML platforms were utilized to build various machine learning models, including ensemble models.
