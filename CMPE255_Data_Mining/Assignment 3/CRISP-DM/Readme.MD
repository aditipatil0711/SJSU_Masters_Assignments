* Information:

CRISP-DM, or Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is a robust, structured methodology for planning and executing data mining projects. It consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Each phase has several tasks that guide users in making informed, deliberate decisions. CRISP-DM is industry-neutral, making it applicable across various domains. It emphasizes understanding business objectives, assessing data quality, building and validating models, and implementing solutions, ensuring the development of reliable, effective data-driven applications.
