## Information:

SEMMA, developed by SAS Institute, stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess. It's a systematic process used for pattern and relationship detection within data. Initially, a representative sample of data is selected. Exploration involves understanding data patterns and relationships. Modification includes data preprocessing and transformation. Modeling applies statistical and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, and Assessment evaluates model performance. SEMMA is pivotal for deriving insights from data, enabling organizations to predict outcomes, optimize operations, and make informed decisions, particularly in analytics-driven domains.
