## Information:

Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) is the comprehensive process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns from large volumes of data. It involves several steps including selection, preprocessing, transformation, data mining, and interpretation/evaluation. The data mining step applies algorithms to extract patterns and knowledge. KDD is crucial in various domains like finance, healthcare, and marketing, enabling insights-driven decision-making. It facilitates the uncovering of hidden patterns and relationships in data, allowing organizations to make informed, proactive decisions and gain competitive advantages.
