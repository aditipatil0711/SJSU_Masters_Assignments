# Problem Statement 2:

Use pycaret to do low code data mining - do not copy paste and submit from examples colab site. you need to rewrite (turnitin willbe used to check matches)  

Pick for each task below a good kaggle data set or some other data set (do not use the same dataset as what pycaretexamples use in official notebooks and my slides )

Implement run and provide output of the colabs of pycaret. Use full automl capabilities of pycaret

Train the models on gpu (use use_gpu=true method in setup function) if it supports for that capabilities (turn gpu on in google colab using youtube tutorial) 

Tasks:

  1) Binary Classification - Level

  2) Multiclass Classification - Level

  3) Regression - Level

  4) Clustering - Level

  5) Anomaly Detection - Level

  6) Association Rules Mining - Level

  7) Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables

  8) Time Series Forecasting - Univariate with Exogenous Variables

(some examples - https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/tutorialsLinks to an external site. use different data sets)

Also do demo of atleast 2 examples in gradio -
