# Timeseries Forecasting

*Explanation:*

Time series forecasting in machine learning involves predicting future values based on past observations from a sequence of time-ordered data points. Commonly used in finance, weather predictions, and sales forecasting, this technique employs algorithms like ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet to analyze trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns in historical data to make future predictions.

*Goal:* 
1) To forecast air quality based on timeseries data: (with exogenous variables)
2) To forecast electic production based on timeseries data: (without exogenous variables)
