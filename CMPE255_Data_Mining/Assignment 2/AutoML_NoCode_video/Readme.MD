What is AutoML?:

AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, streamlines the machine learning process by automating tasks like data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning, making model development faster and more accessible to both experts and novices.

**Description of video:**

In this video, I cover 2 AutoML platforms: JadBio and Obviously.ai

Some amazing platforms leveraging AutoML for non-experts to use machine learning as a no-code platform!

Examples covered

1) JAdBio: Predicting danceability of songs
2) Obviously.ai:  Predicting if a person has diabetes or not
3) Obviously.ai: Predicting the type of migraine a person has
